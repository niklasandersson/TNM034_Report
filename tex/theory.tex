This section presents the underlying knowledge behind some of the methods utilized explained, it is in order for the reader to be able to follow the report with deeper understanding of the current topic.

\subsection{Face detection}

Here in this section are the computation of the eye map and mouth map as well as the theory behind the alignment of the faces explained. All of which are methods that are used when deriving the final output of the face detection phase.
