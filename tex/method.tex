The constructed algorithm consists of three major phases, color correction, face detection and face recognition. The phases are linked together in a chain, meaning that the color corrected image given as output from the color correction phase will serve as input to the face detection phase and that the detected face is delivered as input to the face recognition phase. Finally the recognition phase will determine if the given face is stored in the database.

In this section we will go into detail describing the methods we use in each phase.
