This report presents the different phases that is included for a face recognition pipeline, where the 
given database with test images covers various of problems. The 
goal is to find a model which is suitable to, at some degree, solve: 
geometric invariance, illumination invariance and blur invariance face 
recognition problems. This report will cover each phase with
theory and implementation steps. At the first step, color correction, we 
use black balancing and white balancing to calibrate the color to 
facilitate the post processing operations at later stages.
The second step phase, face detection, where various extraction steps 
are followed: skin tone extraction, background $\&$ foreground extraction, eye 
map extraction and finally mouth map extraction. The combination of the 
extraction operations results in a final detection of the face. Face recognition
, the last step, is done by using a blurr invariant method, LPQ. We have focused
to get an accurate result as possible, rather than e.g. faster computation time.
