With this report is an algorithm for finding and recognizing faces in color images proposed. The established and implemented algorithm is divided into three main phases; \textit{color correction}, \textit{face detection} and \textit{face recognition}. For color correction is a method combining black and white balancing used. The face detection part build upon image segmentation techniques while the recognition part is based on a method involving various \textit{Fourier transforms} called \textit{Local Phase Quantization}. Throughout the report we describe the methods and the accompanying theory we use and base our design decisions on. The report also include a discussion and the presentation of the experimental results achieved.
