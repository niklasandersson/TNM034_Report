In this report an algorithm is proposed for finding and recognizing faces in color images. The established and implemented algorithm is divided into three main phases; \textit{color correction}, \textit{face detection} and \textit{face recognition}. For color correction a method combining black and white balancing is used. The face detection part build upon image segmentation techniques while the recognition part is based on a method called \textit{Local Phase Quantization}, which involves various \textit{Fourier transforms}. Throughout the report we describe the methods and the accompanying theory we use and base our design decisions on. The report also include a discussion and the presentation of the experimental results achieved.
