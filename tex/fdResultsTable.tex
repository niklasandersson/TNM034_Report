The tests were performed to test different types of image problems and conditions, such as: illumination, scale, rotation and blur. The blur tests were done by a gaussian low pass filter with the standard deviation parameter $\sigma$.
The tone level tests were done by decreasing or increasing the intensity value at each pixel with a global percentage parameter I. For example, $ I = 0.5$ decreases the intensity of the image with 50 \%.
All images are rotated with an angle $\theta$ and scaled with a percentage parameter $s$.

\indent Table \ref{tb:result} presents the hit ratio for the face detection with different types of test images and databases.
The images in the database \textit{Access} are persons with access permissons and with different types of background envoriments.
\textit{No access} images on persons that should not be granted access. The images have homogeneous intensities and backgrounds.
The database \textit{Hard} has images with highly varying backgrounds and illumination conditions. Finally, \textit{Test images} is a collection of randomly selected images with various conditions foreground and background conditions.
