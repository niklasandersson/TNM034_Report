This paper describes how to implement a software for face recognition in MATLAB. The implementation should from an input image of an unknown face, detect the face, extract relevant features from it and make a decision if the face in the image belongs to a known person in a database and, if so, to whom? Furthermore the face recognition should work on input images that are modified with a small rotation, scaling or change of tone values.

Some prerequisites were that the images were taken front face and their skin color did not differ a lot from each other. Also the faces eyes and mouths were aligned across all the images.

Face recognition requires solutions to multiple sub problems, such as pre-processing, face detection and feature extraction. Each of these sub problems can be solved in different ways. Down below we list our solution in the different sub problems.

\begin{itemize}
  \item In the pre-process we process the input image to be ready for face detection later on. One important operation in the pre-process is the color correction.
  \item The face detection makes a couple of operations to find the face of the input image. Some examples of operations are: Lighting compensation, Color Space Transformation, Skin color detection.
  \item The feature extraction finds the eyes and the mouth. It also makes a face boundary detection.
  \item The face recognition part can be made using different methods. In this paper the methods \emph{LPQ}\footnote{LPQ - Local phase quantization} and \emph{Eigenfaces} are described.
\end{itemize}
