The first face recognition solution that was looked at was Eigenfaces. It went fast to implement but the group agreed on that the recognition rate was low. Therefore the group searched for other apporaches to the problem. The second approach was to see if Fisherfaces could make a better recognition rate. However a big problem with fisherfaces is that we need more picture of each person in the training set. That made us look into the LPQ solution. The group found a good code on a LPQ solution and by changing certain parameters such as the kernel size the group stumbled upon a good recognition rate.
